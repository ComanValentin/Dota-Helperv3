                    <span class="am-title">Anti-Mage</span> is a fast melee agility hero with an emphasis on disrupting and killing high-mana enemies.
                    He has notably high agility and low base attack time, giving him high damage and scaling with his basic attacks. His signature ability is Mana Break,
                    a passive attack modifier that makes him a huge threat to mana-reliant heroes, mainly Intelligence-based casters. 
                    In addition to granting substantial bonus damage on each attack, its mana burn sets enemies up to be devastated by his ultimate ability, Mana Void. Blink is a highly versatile ability that allows
                     Anti-Mage to instantly teleport short distances, thereby allowing him to escape, chase, and even farm with ease. Combined with his high base movement speed, this makes Anti-Mage a highly
                     mobile hero at all points in the game. Counterspell greatly increases Anti-Mage's magic resistance, allowing him to sustain more damage from enemy casters. 
                     Finally, Mana Void finishes off targets after their mana has been burned, inflicting heavy damage to both the target and enemies surrounding the target. The damage Mana Void can potentially 
                     deal scales extremely well into the late game, as enemies' mana pools only grow larger over time. His naturally fast basic attacks 
                     combined with his powerful abilities make him extremely dangerous in the late game,
                     allowing him to devastate enemies with ease if he is allowed to farm as a hard carry.

                    The monks of Turstarkuri watched the rugged valleys below their mountain monastery as wave after wave of invaders swept through the lower kingdoms. Ascetic and pragmatic, in their remote monastic eyrie they remained aloof from mundane strife, wrapped in meditation that knew no gods or elements of magic. Then came the Legion of the Dead God, crusaders with a sinister mandate to replace all local worship with their Unliving Lord's poisonous nihilosophy. From a landscape that had known nothing but blood and battle for a thousand years, they tore the souls and bones of countless fallen legions and pitched them against Turstarkuri. The monastery stood scarcely a fortnight against the assault, and the few monks who bothered to surface from their meditations believed the invaders were but demonic visions sent to distract them from meditation. They died where they sat on their silken cushions. Only one youth survived--a pilgrim who had come as an acolyte, seeking wisdom, but had yet to be admitted to the monastery. He watched in horror as the monks to whom he had served tea and nettles were first slaughtered, then raised to join the ranks of the Dead God's priesthood. With nothing but a few of Turstarkuri's prized dogmatic scrolls, he crept away to the comparative safety of other lands, swearing to obliterate not only the Dead God's magic users--but to put an end to magic altogether.
